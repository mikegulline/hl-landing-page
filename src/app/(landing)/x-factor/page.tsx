              On Nov. 21, 2019 the way I habitually experienced myself and the
              world radically changed.{' '}
            </strong>
            That day I realized I no longer needed money or anything else for
            that matter to be happy. As ridiculous as it may sound, that day the
            world including myself seemed perfect. A week later my chronic
            aches, pains and depression were gone. But the real mind blower came
            when I noticed the chattering, badgering, judgmental little voice in
            my head had vanished. For the first time in my life I was present,
            fully present, alert and clear beyond description.

          <P>
            I had just spent 7 days trying my latest version of enhanced hemp
            extract I call CANNABITOL®, the same version my good friend Dr.
            Lee, a legendary Chinese herbologist and master practitioner of
            traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), helped formulate. I knew then
            that enhanced CANNABITOL® could well become the most wildly
            effective supplement ever developed. What X factor is, how enhanced
            CANNABITOL® and its gummy version BLISS BOMBS™ came to be, and
            most importantly, what it can do for you is the subject of the true
            story that follows.
          </P>

          <H2>MYSTERY</H2>
          <P>
            I love nature, I love it for the same reason I love life itself,
            mystery, beautiful, blessed, glorious mystery. No matter how hard
            and long we try, no matter what story we tell ourselves, be it
            scientific or otherwise, at the core of nature, indeed at the core
            of life itself lies mystery,
          </P>

          <P>
            To be sure, I respect science. My businesses are based on science.
            I&apos;ve always had a team of top notch scientists help me develop
            whatever new formulation I&apos;m working on.
          </P>

          <P>
            I&apos;ve been in the supplement business for 40 years. I am
            currently the CEO of IMMUNOCORP which I founded 25 years ago. I am
            also the CEO of HempLand USA which I founded 9 years ago.
          </P>

          <P>
            If you look at my most popular products, the products that have gone
            on to become world class brands like ARCTIC RUBY® OIL and IMMUTOL®
            from IMMUNOCORP and CANNABITOL® from HempLand® USA they all have
            one thing in common, an abundance of what scientists call X factor.
            It&apos;s the mysterious something, currently unexplainable by
            science, that somehow imbues the product with a power to deliver
            health benefits that literally defy reason.{' '}
          </P>

          <P>
            In 2013 I fell in love with hemp extract precisely because I was
            convinced it contained the mother lode of X factor. Hemp extract
            could reportedly deliver extraordinary health benefits for a
            multitude of conditions.{' '}
          </P>

          <P>
            I became so obsessed with hemp extract that I started HempLand USA
            in 2014 to produce what I hoped would be the finest hemp products
            available. But, as with all things you fall in love with, your
            undoing is potentially somewhere in the mix.
          </P>

          <H2>My Undoing </H2>

          <P>
            From its inception HempLand USA had problems. Simultaneous to its
            founding in 2014 demand for hemp extract skyrocketed to a degree I
            have never seen in the supplement industry. The public had been
            hyped by several documentaries on CNN that pretty much said hemp
            extract could cure anything. The public bought it.{' '}
          </P>

          <P>
            Hemp extract was quasi legal because of a clause in the 2014 Farm
            Bill allowing hemp to be grown under certain conditions. The only
            state that met those conditions was Colorado which had legalized
            marijuana, a few years prior. Colorado was inundated with hippie
            would be pot entrepreneurs who naturally migrated to cannabis&apos;
            look alike cousin hemp when they discovered hemp extract could be
            sold in every other state that cannabis was not legal, most, because
            hemp contains very little THC, the substance in cannabis that makes
            you high.{' '}
          </P>

          <P>
            I had to wade into the summer of love to secure hemp extract which
            contains upwards of 80% CBD. Imagine trying to do serious business
            at Woodstock, not good. At that time hemp extract was selling for
            the unbelievable price of $80,000 a kilo! “Supply and demand bro,” I
            was constantly told, Eventually I was forced to go into partnership
            with a Colorado hemp farmer and buy my own extraction facility.
            Costly.{' '}
          </P>

          <P>
            A year later Hempland USA was producing I believed the finest hemp
            products on the market. We had the expertise and manufacturing
            facility to do just that. The demand for hemp extract continued to
            skyrocket, as more and more people discovered that hemp extract was
            different than all other supplements. It actually worked, especially
            for pain, anxiety, stress and mood swings. Good thing for HempLand
            USA right? Then the dam broke. In 2018 hemp was made federally legal
            to grow in all states.{' '}
          </P>

          <P>
            Thousand of companies entered the hemp market. Hemp extract could be
            purchased everywhere. It even showed up in restaurants as a menu
            item. On the positive side the price for hemp extract went down,
            still expensive, but down. On the negative side the competition was
            epic.
          </P>

          <P>
            No matter how much money HempLand USA spent marketing our
            &apos;superior&apos; hemp products we were drowned out by countless
            companies saying the same thing. In point of fact there were many
            companies selling excellent hemp extract products, too many.
          </P>

          <P>
            I could see the writing on the wall. Funds were low, so low I
            contemplated pulling the plug. My team was devastated. They had been
            with me for years. We never failed. Now it was a real possibility.
          </P>

          <H2>Dr. Lee and TCM</H2>

          <P>
            My friend, Dr. Lee, is by any standard an extraordinary man. At an
            advanced age he is still wining national Sudoko and Go championships
            in China. To say he is sharp would be an enormous understatement. As
            I&apos;ve mentioned, Dr. Lee is a renowned herbologist and master
            TCM practitioner. I didn&apos;t mention that he also holds
            Ph.D&apos;s in organic chemistry and neuroscience. In addition, he
            the owner of one of China&apos;s oldest TCM manufacturing facilities
            located just outside Shanghai.{' '}
          </P>

          <P>
            Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is different in several
            fundamental ways from western medicine, but it&apos;s also based on
            the same principal, empiricism, the belief that objective
            observation is the most accurate way to determine facts. On that
            score Chinese doctors have been objectively observing by trial and
            error the healing effects of natural remedies for at least 50
            centuries!
          </P>

          <P>
            TCM views your body as an energy field consisting of ying and yang
            (male and female) expressions of a mysterious vital energy they call
            Qi, pronounced Chee. From my point of view Qi is simply the Chinese
            word for X factor!
          </P>

          <P>
            TCM sees all health problems as an indication that ying and yang are
            either out of balance or blocked. It&apos;s the job of a TCM
            practitioner to restore free flowing balanced QI. They do so by
            primarily administering herbal remedies that do essentially the same
            thing as CBD, restore balance.
          </P>

          <P>
            Scientist believe hemp extract works by supporting your incredible
            endocannabinoid system (ECS). When health problems strike, the sole
            task of your ECS is to restore balance in your body. Sounds like TCM
            correct? I couldn&apos;t think of any scientist or physician that
            understood more about how to naturally restore bodily balance than
            Dr. Lee.{' '}
          </P>

          <P>
            As a last ditch effort to save HempLand® from going out of business
            I sought Dr. Lee&apos;s help. It was not the first time I asked him
            for help. A few years ago, Dr. Lee was instrumental in developing a
            mental acuity product for IMMUNOCORP. He brilliantly combined TCM
            with natural western ingredients. The result was nothing short of
            amazing. It&apos;s called ACUITOL and quickly became a runaway best
            seller.{' '}
          </P>

          <P>
            Maybe Dr. Lee could do it again, combine east with west and blow
            away the competition. He didn&apos;t let me down.
          </P>

          <P>
            I contacted Dr. Lee and sent him a sample of CANNABITOL® FULL
            SPECTRUM HEMP EXTRACT OIL, containing 5000mg of our signature
            product, He quickly got back to me with a single question:
          </P>

          <P>
            “Why would you ever sell hemp oil extract as a stand alone product?
            It&apos;s needs its family to get the desired results!”
          </P>

          <P>
            Dr. Lee explained to me that hemp extract is a foundational
            balancing herb in TCM and has been used for as long as TCM has
            existed. Its the basis for formulations that alleviate anxiety, over
            exertion, pain and melancholy. Hemp extract based formulations allow
            optimal function of the “5 zàng organs”, the Heart, Spleen, Lungs,
            Kidney, and Liver, especially improving their associative Qi
            dynamic. TCM formulations are always a combination of herbs that
            function as a synergistic whole to balance Qi,
          </P>

          <P>
            He told me he would get back to me. Two weeks later 5 organic herbal
            oil extracts arrived, black pepper extract, rosemary extract, clove
            extract, hops extract and juju be extract, with detailed
            instructions on the amounts to be mixed with CANNANBTOL®.
          </P>

          <P>
            My team followed his instructions to the letter. On Nov. 19, 2019, I
            was the first person to try Dr. Lee&apos;s formulation. As I stated
            at the beginning, the results were life changing.{' '}
          </P>

          <P>
            After using me as the guinea pig and witnessing the results, I was
            literally a different person, the rest of my team, 9 in all, tried
            Dr. Lee&apos;s formulation. The results were equally profound.{' '}
          </P>

          <P>To a person we knew our resurrection was at hand. X factor!</P>

          <H2>Resurrection</H2>

          <P>
            The 5 herbal extracts that Dr. Lee chose I later called ECS5 after
            my team informed me that all 5 extracts were backed by numerous
            scientific studies that demonstrated their ability, like hemp
            extract to support your endocannabinoid system (ECS) in its vital
            job at maintaining homeostasis (balance). However, as with hemp
            extract, science has no explanation for the myriad of other health
            benefits these 5 herbal extracts obviously confer, except X factor.
          </P>

          <P>
            To let the public know that HempLand USA had developed a new hemp
            extract product that was without question far superior than all
            other hemp extract products are, or could ever hope to be, I used
            the oldest and most effective form or advertising known, word of
            mouth.
          </P>

          <P>
            I simply asked my team to give ECS5 enhanced CANNABITOL® 5000 to
            family and friends. That&apos;s all it took. Sales grew quickly and
            exponentially. Here&apos;s a sample of what our tidal wave of new
            customers are saying:
