                On Nov. 21, 2019 the way I habitually experienced myself and the
                world radically changed.
              </strong>
              That day I realized I no longer needed money or anything else for
              that matter to be happy. As ridiculous as it may sound, that day
              the world including myself seemed perfect. A week later my chronic
              aches, pains and bad moods were gone. But the real mind blower
              came when I noticed the chattering, badgering, judgmental little
              voice in my head had vanished. For the first time in my life I was
              present, fully present, alert and clear beyond description.

              I had just spent 7 days trying my latest version of enhanced hemp
              extract I call CANNABITOL®, the same version my good friend Dr.
              Lee, a legendary Chinese herbologist and master practitioner of
              traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), helped formulate. I knew then
              that enhanced CANNABITOL® could well become the most wildly
              effective supplement ever developed. What X factor is, how
              enhanced CANNABITOL® came to be, and most importantly, what it
              can do for you is the subject of the true story that follows.

              I love nature, I love it for the same reason I love life itself,
              mystery, beautiful, blessed, glorious mystery. No matter how hard
              and long we try, no matter what story we tell ourselves, be it
              scientific or otherwise, at the core of nature, indeed at the core
              of life itself lies mystery,
            </P>

            <P>
              To be sure, I respect science. My businesses are based on science.
              I&apos;ve always had a team of top notch scientists help me

              If you look at my most popular products, the products that have
              gone on to become world class brands like ARCTIC RUBY® OIL and
              IMMUTOL® from IMMUNOCORP and CANNABITOL® from HempLand® USA
              they all have one thing in common, an abundance of what scientists
              call X factor. It&apos;s the mysterious something, currently
              unexplainable by science, that somehow imbues the product with a
              power to deliver health benefits that literally defy reason.

            <P>
              In 2013 I fell in love with hemp extract precisely because I was
              convinced it contained the mother lode of X factor. Hemp extract
              could reportedly deliver extraordinary health benefits for a
              multitude of conditions.

            <P>
              I became so obsessed with hemp extract that I started HempLand USA
              in 2014 to produce what I hoped would be the finest hemp products
              available. But, as with all things you fall in love with, your
              undoing is potentially somewhere in the mix.

            <P>
              From its inception HempLand USA had problems. Simultaneous to its
              founding in 2014 demand for hemp extract skyrocketed to a degree I
              have never seen in the supplement industry. The public had been
              hyped by several documentaries on CNN that pretty much said hemp
              extract could cure anything. The public bought it.
            </P>

            <P>
              Hemp extract was quasi legal because of a clause in the 2014 Farm
              Bill allowing hemp to be grown under certain conditions. The only
              state that met those conditions was Colorado which had legalized
              pot, a few years prior. Colorado was inundated with hippie would
              be pot entrepreneurs who naturally migrated to pot&apos;s look
              alike cousin hemp when they discovered hemp extract could be sold
              in every other state that pot was not legal, most, because hemp
              contains very little of the substance in pot that makes you high.
            </P>

            <P>
              I had to wade into the summer of love to secure hemp extract.
              Imagine trying to do serious business at Woodstock, not good. At
              that time hemp extract was selling for the unbelievable price of
              $80,000 a kilo! &quot;Supply and demand bro,&quot; I was
              constantly told, Eventually I was forced to go into partnership
              with a Colorado hemp farmer and buy my own extraction facility.
              Costly.

              A year later Hempland USA was producing, I believed, the finest
              hemp products on the market. We had the expertise and
              manufacturing facility to do just that. The demand for hemp
              extract continued to skyrocket, as more and more people discovered
              that hemp extract was different than all other supplements. It
              actually worked, especially for pain, anxiety, stress and mood
              swings. Good thing for HempLand USA right? Then the dam broke. In
              2018 hemp was made federally legal to grow in all states.
            </P>

            <P>
              Thousand of companies entered the hemp market. Hemp extract could
              be purchased everywhere. It even showed up in restaurants as a
              menu item. On the positive side the price for hemp extract went
              down, still expensive, but down. On the negative side the
              competition was epic.
            </P>

            <P>
              No matter how much money HempLand USA spent marketing our
              &apos;superior&apos; hemp products we were drowned out by
              countless companies saying the same thing. In point of fact there
              were many companies selling excellent hemp extract products, too
              many.

              I could see the writing on the wall. Funds were low, so low I

            <ArticleImage src={TCM} alt='TCM' />
            <P>
              My friend, Dr. Lee, is by any standard an extraordinary man. At an
              advanced age he is still wining national Sudoko and Go
              championships in China. To say he is sharp would be an enormous
              understatement. As I&apos;ve mentioned, Dr. Lee is a renowned
              herbologist and master TCM practitioner. I didn&apos;t mention
              that he also holds Ph.D&apos;s in organic chemistry and
              neuroscience. In addition, he the owner of one of China&apos;s
              oldest TCM manufacturing facilities located just outside Shanghai.
            </P>

            <P>
              Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is different in several
              fundamental ways from western medicine, but it&apos;s also based
              on the same principal, empiricism, the belief that objective
              observation is the most accurate way to determine facts. On that
              score Chinese doctors have been objectively observing by trial and
              error the healing effects of natural remedies for at least 50
              centuries!
            </P>

            <P>
              TCM views your body as an energy field consisting of ying and yang
              (male and female) expressions of a mysterious vital energy they
              call Qi, pronounced Chee. From my point of view Qi is simply the
              Chinese word for X factor!
            </P>

            <P>
              TCM sees all health problems as an indication that ying and yang
              are either out of balance or blocked. It&apos;s the job of a TCM
              practitioner to restore free flowing balanced QI. They do so by
              primarily administering herbal remedies that do essentially the
              same thing as hemp extract, restore balance.
            </P>

            <P>
              Scientist believe hemp extract works by supporting your incredible
              endocannabinoid system (ECS). When health problems strike, the
              sole task of your ECS is to restore balance in your body. Sounds
              like TCM correct? I couldn&apos;t think of any scientist or
              physician that understood more about how to naturally restore
              bodily balance than Dr. Lee.
            </P>

            <P>
              As a last ditch effort to save HempLand® from going out of
              business I sought Dr. Lee&apos;s help. It was not the first time I
              asked him for help. A few years ago, Dr. Lee was instrumental in
              developing a mental acuity product for IMMUNOCORP. He brilliantly
              combined TCM with natural western ingredients. The result was
              nothing short of amazing. It&apos;s called ACUITOL and quickly
              became a runaway best seller.
            </P>

            <P>
              Maybe Dr. Lee could do it again, combine east with west and blow
              away the competition. He didn&apos;t let me down.
            </P>

            <P>
              I contacted Dr. Lee and sent him a sample of signature hemp
              extract product CANNABITOL® 5000. He quickly got back to me with
              a single question:
            </P>

            <P>
              <span className='italic'>
                &quot;Why would you ever sell hemp oil extract as a stand alone
                product? It&apos;s needs its family to get the desired
                results!&quot;
              </span>
            </P>

            <P>
              Dr. Lee explained to me that hemp extract is a foundational
              balancing herb in TCM and has been used for as long as TCM has
              existed. Its the basis for formulations that alleviate anxiety,
              over exertion, pain and melancholy. Hemp extract based
              formulations allow optimal function of the &quot;5 zàng
              organs&quot;, the heart, spleen, lungs, kidney, and liver,
              especially improving their associative Qi dynamic. TCM
              formulations are always a combination of herbs that function as a
              synergistic whole to balance Qi.
            </P>

            <P>
              He told me he would get back to me. Two weeks later 5 organic
              herbal oil extracts arrived, black pepper extract, rosemary
              extract, clove extract, hops extract and jujube extract, with
              detailed instructions on the amounts to be mixed with
              CANNANBTOL®.
            </P>

            <P>
              My team followed his instructions to the letter. On Nov. 19, 2019,
              I was the first person to try Dr. Lee&apos;s formulation. As I
              stated at the beginning, the results were life changing.
            </P>

            <P>
              After using me as the guinea pig and witnessing the results, I was
              literally a different person, the rest of my team, 9 in all, tried
              Dr. Lee&apos;s formulation. The results were equally profound.

              The 5 herbal extracts that Dr. Lee chose I later called ECS5 after
              my team informed me that all 5 extracts were backed by numerous
              scientific studies that demonstrated their ability, like hemp
              extract to support your endocannabinoid system (ECS) in its vital
              job at maintaining homeostasis (balance). However, as with hemp
              extract, science has no explanation for the myriad of other health
              benefits these 5 herbal extracts obviously confer, except X
              factor.

              To let the public know that HempLand USA had developed a new hemp
              extract product that was without question far superior than all
              other hemp extract products are, or could ever hope to be, I used
              the oldest and most effective form or advertising known, word of

            </P>

            <P>
              I simply asked my team to give ECS5 enhanced CANNABITOL® 5000 to
              family and friends. That&apos;s all it took. Sales grew quickly
              and exponentially. Here&apos;s a sample of what our tidal wave of

                <strong>This is going to be a strange testimonial </strong>
                because I don&apos;t possess the words capable of describing the
                indescribable. At the risk of going all woo woo on you I&apos;ll
                give it a shot. CANNABITOL® helped a very introverted,
                complaining, hypochondriac, according to my wife, come out of
                his shell. Strange experiences are constantly happening. I
                notice things more, a lot more. I feel like the wind is at my
                back if that makes any sense at all. That&apos;s the best I can

                CANNABITOL® obliterated my bad moods and helped me for once

                marketing hype. Never! CANNABITOL® did! It beat my expectations
                by a mile. I am a moody person by nature, you couple that with
                my constant joint pain and I&apos;m not a very pleasant person.
                That&apos;s just the way I am, and have been for years. One of
                the few friends I have told me about CANNABITOL® and how it
                took away his back pain and changed his outlook on life.

                I listened to her because my friend is probably the most
                negative person I know. That&apos;s why we&apos;re friends. We
                love to complain about everything. LOL! I ordered CANNABITOL®.
                It arrived quickly. I liked that. I think from the very first
                day I tried CANNABITOL® things started to feel different. For
                one thing my mood changed. I felt happy. Me happy? It
                couldn&apos;t be! But I was! Within a few days my joint pain
                went down. Within a week the pain was gone! Can you believe it,
                now my friend and I sit around and laugh at just about
                everything. What more can I say about CANNABITOL®. It&apos;s
                incredible!&quot;

              Look, I&apos;m not saying that ECS5 Enhanced CANNABITOL® 5000
              will completely cure all your health problems. But I am saying
              that an awful lot of people, just like you, are very happy with
              what it has done for them. You&apos;ve just read a few examples.
              Why not experience what ECS5 Enhanced CANNABITOL® 5000 can do for
              you? It&apos;s loaded with X factor like no other product. You
              won&apos;t be disappointed.
