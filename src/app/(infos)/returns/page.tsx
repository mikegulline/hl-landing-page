                Please note that returns for bulk orders will be eligible for a
                full refund on a case by case basis. Any order that includes the
                purchase of 2 or more of the same type of product using the bulk
                discount is considered a bulk order, and full refunds on bulk
                orders are discretionary.
              </p>

              <p>
                It is our expectation that if you purchase bulk quantities of a
                specific product, that you should only need to test no more than
                2 bottles to determine your satisfaction with the product.
